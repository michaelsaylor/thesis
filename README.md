# Theoretically Calculating the Energy and Momentum of Heavy Mesons in Ultra-Peripheral at the LHC
Includes all of the code I used for my Schreyer Honors thesis except the dependencies: LHPADF 6.5.3, Root, ALGLIB, and Python 3.10. These files are edited using CLion and is run using Ubuntu 22.04.

I will create a computer programming code, based off of the LHAPDF open-source code, which will theoretically calculate the energy and momentum of the daughter particles after a proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions that can happen at the Large Hadron Collider. These theoretically calculated values will be compared with the experimentally measured values.
